Open Internals is a podcast for developers interested in how popular open source libraries are made. We talk to package maintainers and dive deep into the architecture, organization and implementation details. The podcast will be about an hour long and a new episode arrives roughly weekly. 

It is hosted by Darshan Chaudhary ([@deathbullet](https://twitter.com/deathbullet), [github.com/darshanime](https://github.com/darshanime)), who works as a backend developer with Draup, Zinnov.

Suggestions and ideas welcome! Feel free to reach out at deathbullet@gmail.com
