Zulip is a open source group chat application powered by a Python backend. In this podcast, I talk to Steve Howell, who is one of the longest serving core team members at Zulip. 


We start with the history of Zulip and move on to talk about the architecture details including the lifecycle of a message, the major components powering Zulip, the database schema to store the messages etc.
